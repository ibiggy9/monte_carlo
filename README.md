# monte_carlo
This is a python program that takes user input to define parameters for a random triangular monte carlo simulation for the purposes of producing the probabilities of outcomes to improve forecasting. 

The reason I used randomized triangle dist was because its most adaptable distribution for most forecasts. 

This is a very simple first pass. What I would like to do is eliminate all globals and create classes that inheret the variables as methods to simplify the multiprocessing.
